	"atm9.quest.spawner.desc.apotheosis": "Apotheosis is quite a big mod so I'm dividing it in 3 quests chapters. The Enchanting and Affixes will be separate. This one is for normal game changes.",
	"atm9.quest.spawner.desc.changes": "Apotheosis adds some small changes to Minecraft, don't worry all are good and helpful!",
	"atm9.quest.spawner.desc.anvil": "Some of the items changed with Apotheosis is Enchantments for Anvils and Shears. Shears can now use the normal enchants but now including fortune and new enchants. Shears can get Growth Serum, Chromatic Aberation, and Workers Explotiation. You can discover what they do yourself. The Anvils can now be enchanted with Unbreaking and new enchants as well! Splitting and Obleritation. Both are used on the anvil then use the Enchanted Anvil to drop it on an Enchanted Book.",
	"atm9.quest.spawner.desc.cactus": "You ever get bored of the 'normal' heights for cacti, bamboo, and sugarcane? You ever wish to see skyscrapers of Bamboo? Apotheosis can bring you your croppy Skyscrapers! Now height limits for Cacti, Bamboo, and Sugarcane have been increased! To how much? IDK, how tall is world height limit?",
	"atm9.quest.spawner.desc.fletcher": "The Fletching Table has been here since 1.14 and still is only used for a villager job! What about the players job?!?! Instead of making arrows with potion effects in a crafting table you can now use the Fletching Table. It's just cooler and more professional to use the designated table for it.",
	"atm9.quest.spawner.desc.spawner": "Another game change Apotheosis brings is to Spawners. Remember being able to mine Spawners with Silk Touch? Well it's back thanks to Apotheosis! There's also many new Modifications you can add to Spawners by right clicking any of these items.",
	"atm9.quest.spawner.desc.prismarine": "Activation Range is how close the Player (You) must be to the Spawner for it to work. The lowest it can be is 1 block away and the highest is 48 blocks away. They go in a circle around the spawner instead of direct blocks. The Condiut and Dragon Egg will ignore these.",
	"atm9.quest.spawner.desc.ghast": "Max entities is the amount of mobs that can be spawned by a spawner and kept. If it's only 6 max entities when 6 mobs are already spawned no more will spawned until they're dead or moved. Each Ghast Tear brings it up or down 2 Entities. Max of 16 Entities and Minimum of 1.",
	"atm9.quest.spawner.desc.atm": "To determine when the Spawner will spawn it picks a random number between maximum and minimum spawn delay. The Minimum can be as low as 100 to as high as 32,767. Each Ingot goes up or down by 10.",
	"atm9.quest.spawner.desc.unob": "The Maximum Spawn Delay is how long it could take to spawn mobs. Just like the Minimum it can be as low as 100 to as high as 32,767. Each Ingot gives 10. The numbers are Minecraft ticks, 20 ticks equals 1 second. So quickest spawn delay would be 5 seconds between each.",
	"atm9.quest.spawner.desc.quartz": "The Quartz makes whatever the other item does, it does the opposite for the Spawner. With Quartz in your offhand and the other Spawner Modification item in your main it will do the opposite of its role. With Quartz and Blaze Rods instead of increasing Spawn Range it will decrease it. With Quartz and Ghast Tears it'll decrease Max Entities.",
	"atm9.quest.spawner.desc.lantern": "Some mobs (mostly monsters) need certain Light Levels to spawn. Hostile ones needing lower levels and passive needing higher ones. Using a Soul Lantern makes it so you never have to worry about Light Levels as it ignores them! This does not ignore other requirements for spawning like livestock animals needing Grass. It's another one that gets ignored by Dragon Egg.",
	"atm9.quest.spawner.desc.redstone": "Redstone Activation gives your spawner an on/off switch. Without Redstone Power it will not spawn.",
	"atm9.quest.spawner.desc.conduit": "The Conduit will do what the Prismarine Shards do but much better. Players no longer need to be near the spawner. As long as its chunk-loaded it will spawn.",
	"atm9.quest.spawner.desc.dragon": "The must-need for all Spawners. When it says ignores all conditions, it means all conditions (not really all). Ignores light levels, blocks needing for spawning, and players being near. Space conditions are still needed though, like slimes needing 3x3 area to spawn.",
	"atm9.quest.spawner.desc.wool": "Wool only does one thing to the spawner and that's to shut it up. Don't like hearing the stupid Spawner noises? Then use Wool! Any color, thread count, or design!",
	"atm9.quest.spawner.desc.piglich": "The Piglich Heart is dropped by... well the Piglich. It can be used to increase the amount of mobs that CAN spawn from a spawner. The Mobs spawned is random with a Maximum amount determined by the Piglich Hearts. It goes up or down by 1 for each heart to a maximum of 8.",
	"atm9.quest.spawner.desc.apple": "By using a Golden Apple on a Spawner you suck the souls out the mobs that will be spawned, only leaving a hollow husk of what they used to be. The mobs will lose all AI so they will do basically what an armor stand does. They can't hit you, can't teleport, can't move on their own. They sit there ready to be killed, how exciting!",
	"atm9.quest.spawner.desc.egg": "This one might be new to ones returning from earlier versions. By using a turtle egg on a spawner, it will only spawn in baby versions of the mobs in it. This only works with Vanilla baby versions of mobs, not modded.",
	"atm9.quest.spawner.desc.rods": "The Spawn Range is the area of where mobs can spawn. The bigger the area, the more room for them to spawn in. The smaller the area the cheaper the factory.",

	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.enchant": "Enchanting gets a few changes with Apotheosis. To summarize it, 15 bookshelves won't be enough now. There's new bookshelves and actions you can do with Enchantment Tables now and hopefully these quests will help you understand.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.book": "Bookshelves are your starting point, but definitely not your end point. Atleast not normal bookshelves. With only normal bookshelves you can only get Eterna up and to a max of 15. (I will explain the Enchantment Levels soon but just know you need them up)",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.hellshelf": "Hellshelves are your introduction to Quanta, they give 3% Quanta and 1.5 Eterna. Better than normal shelves right? You're going to need atleast 6 of them for the next step.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.seashelf": "Seashelves are your introduction to Arcana, they give 2% Arcana and 1.5 Eterna. Better than normal shelves right? You're going to need atleast 6 of them for the next step.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.infusion": "Infusion is a special version of Enchanting which ironically is used for better enchantments. When the right amount of Eterna, Quanta, and Arcana is reached the enchantments will offer Infusion. (To know the Levels needed you can check JEI or follow these Quests)",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.arcana": "Arcana is very important quantity, it increases the amount of Enchantments you get and makes rare Enchantments more common. An example would be like with Swords, smite is a very common enchantment but looting is much more rare. Arcanas default is 0% and max is 100%.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.quanta": "Quanta sets how random the Enchants you get will be. It can be used against you though depending on Retification. If the Quanta is high and Retification is low, you're more likely to get bad enchantments and curses. Default Quanta 15% and its max is 100%. Retification default is 0% and max is 100%.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.eterna": "Eterna sets the Enchantment Level which determines what Enchantments you can or will get. It's default is 0 and max is 50.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.negative": "Some infusions need very very exact amounts of Eterna, Quanta, or Arcana to get these you might need one of these shelves. Each lowers the amount of its respective amounts.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.other": "It's not just bookshelves that can be Infused!",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.charms": "Charms are new parts with Apotheosis that allows you to get Potion Effects for much longer. You can Infuse them to make them Unbreakable. It needs 50 Eterna, between 8.5 and 13.5 Quanta, and between 32.5 to 37.5 Arcana. One way you can do this is with 5 Draconic Endshelves, 6 Glowing Hellshelves, 1 Blazing Hellshelves, 1 Heart-Forged Seashelf, and 2 Melonshelves. {BTW I used any curios charm tag so some items that can be used in the quest can not be made Unbreakable, only Apotheosis Charms can.)",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.trident": "Apotheosis knows how annoying Tridents can be to get so they made it easier... well kinda easier. You can now make an Inert Trident and Infuse it to get a normal Trident. The Trident requires between 20-30 Eterna, 20%-50% Quanta, and atleast 35% Arcana. You can get this with 4 Echoing Skulkshelves or 2 Crystalline Seashelves and 6 Heart-Forged Seashelves.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.library": "This is arguably one of the most important blocks added by Apotheosis, the Enchantment Library. You put Books in and they collect over time and can be taken out anytime. Warning 1. It has limits, high limits but limits 2. It can only take out the highest level put in regardless of how many are in.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.alexandria": "The Library of Alexandria is a better Enchantment Library. It can hold more, that's it. you need to Infuse a Enchantment Library. It needs exactly 50 Eterna, between 45%-50% Quanta, and 100% Arcana. This can be done with 7 Echoing Skulkshelves and 2 Draconic Shelves.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.infused_hellshelf": "In order to get higher Max Enchantments and levels you'll need Infused Hellshelves. To get them you will need 22.5 Eterna and 30% Quanta. The best way to get that would be 15 normal shelves and 5 Hellshelves.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.infused_seashelf": "If you want higher Eterna and Arcana you'll need Infused Seashelves. To get them you need atleast 22.5 Eterna, 15% Quanta, and 10% Arcana. The best way to get that is 15 Bookshelves and 5 Seashelves. (15% Quanta is default you won't need Hellshelves for this).",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.sight": "You ever spend 3 months studying Galatic Code to finally understand Enchantment Table language just for it to be gibberish? No? Me either but Enchanting Clues are your actual translator for it. Each Enchanting Clue will tell you 1 Enchantment before you actually use it.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.retification": "Retification is a quantity that works with Quanta, it determines if the enchantments will be good or bad. The more Retification the better the Enchantments. Definitely necessary for those wanting good gear.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.blazing": "The Blazing Hellshelf is an upgrade to the Infused Hellshelf. It increases max Eterna to 30. The negative Enchanting Clue makes it a little worse for normal Enchanting, instead we can use it for better Infusion.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.glowing": "The Glowing Hellshelf is an upgrade to the Infused Hellshelf. It also increases the Max Eterna but it's not the stats we're looking for in order to Enchant. Definitely good for normal Enchanting though!",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.crystalline": "The Crystalline Seashelf is an upgrade to the Infused Seashelf. It's very good for normal Enchantments but doesn't give us enough Arcana for the next Infusion we'll need. Still good stats for normal Enchanting though!",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.heart-forged": "The Heart-Forged Seashelf is another upgrade to the Infused Seashelf. It's a little expensive but gives the Arcana we'll need for Infusion and later Enchanting. The Negative Retification makes it a little worse for normal Enchanting though as it's important for getting good Enchantments.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.deepshelf": "The Deepshelf (not dormant) is your next step to Enchanting. Like everything else it needs Infusion. The Deepshelf needs 30 Eterna, 40% Quanta, and 40% Arcana. You can get that with 5 Blazing Hellshelves and 4 Heart-Forged Seashelves.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.Soul_deep": "Like an improved Hellshelf, the Soul Touched Deepshelf gives a lot of Quanta, it does give higher Eterna max to 37.5 though! Which means better Enchants!",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.Soul_sculk": "Suprisingly you don't need infusion for these! You just need to kill the most powerful boss in vanilla Minecraft! The Skulk shelves increase Eterna to 40 which will allow us to Infuse the next item.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.echo_deep": "A little expensive but the Echoing Deep Shelf is like a much better Seashelf. (BTW you'll need to kill quite a few wardens to advance more in Enchanting... shoulda warned you earlier). Also increases Max Eterna to 37.5.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.echo_sculk": "You might need to kill a few Wardens for these but that's okay Apotheosis makes it easier! This shelf is mostly for Arcana but it's a good source for all quantities. It will be needed for next Infusion.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.endshelf": "The last sets of Shelves you'll need are Endshelves, to get them you need Infused Dragon's Breath. This one was hard to get but you need atleast 40% Eterna, 15%-25% Quanta, and atleast 60% Arcana. It has to be between 15%-25% Quanta to get that you can try 9 Echoing Skulkshelves and 4 Melonshelves or 2 Echoing Skulkshelves and 10 Heart-Forged Seashelves.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.pearlescent": "The Pearlescent Endshelf is the best all-around shelf. It also gives a Max Eterna of 45, but this isn't the shelf we're looking for to get perfect set up.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.draconic": "The Draconic Shelf is the last Shelf we'll need for perfect set up. It might only give Eterna but it has the Max Max Eterna of 50.",
	"atm9.quest.enchant.desc.perfect": "Ever want THE most perfect Enchants? Then this is the setup you need, for 100% everything. 7 Echoing Skulkshelves, 4 Soul-Touched Deepshelves, and 5 Draconic Shelves will get you 50 Eterna, 100% Quanta, 100% Arcana and 8 Enchanting Clues. 4 Shelves of End Fused Retification will give 100% Retification. And Deepshelf of Arcane Treasures will top it all off with Treasure Enchantments.",
