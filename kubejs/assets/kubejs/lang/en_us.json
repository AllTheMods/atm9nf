Just like Amethyst, you will find Certus Quartz Crystals that you can mine for Certus Quartz &eDust&f and &eCrystals&f. \\n \\n For more information on AE2 beyond this chapter, consult the wiki over at",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.wrench": "The &bQuartz Wrench&f does what any regular tech mod wrench would do. It rotates blocks and devices along the face you right-click on and dismantles them when right-clicked while sneaking. \\n \\n AE2's wrench comes in both certus and nether quartz flavours.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.first": "Two of the very first things you will need to get started in AE2 are the &bCharger&f and the &bInscriber&f. \\n \\n The &bCharger&f, when supplied with power, will take &eCertus Quartz Crystals&r and charge them. These &eCharged Certus Crystals&r can then be used in the production of &eFluix&f, another important resource in the mod. It can also be used to charge any item that stores power. \\n \\n The &bInscriber&f can be used to turn the various quartz crystals in AE2 into their dust form, but more importantly is used to fabricate special &ePrinted Circuits&f and &eProcessors&f, as will become clearer in the next quest.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.energy_acceptor": "While the Inscriber and Charger will natively accept RF/FE, the vast majority of an ME network uses its own dedicated power system called AE. \\n \\n RF/FE can be converted into the native AE at a ratio of 2:1 RF:AE, either directly through an ME Controller, or through the &bEnergy Acceptor&f, which can instead be connected to any part of the network.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.energy_cell": "By default, an ME network on its own only has an internal buffer of 800AE without an ME Controller, with the controller adding an extra 8kAE per block. For large enough networks, this can be insufficient and may cause a network to power off intermittently when trying to recoup power for any connected devices. \\n \\n The &bEnergy Cell&f allows for an ME network to hold significantly more energy, adding another 200kAE per regular Energy Cell and 1.6MAE per &bDense&f Energy Cell. These can also be placed anywhere in the network to provide the increased energy buffer.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.energy_card": "The &bEnergy Card&f can be applied to most chargeable devices like Portable Cells and Wireless Terminals (covered later) to also increase &otheir&r energy buffer.",

These can be either on the surface or underground, and contain a &bMysterious Cube&f in its center. \\n \\n This cube contains all of the different &ePresses&f used in the Inscriber to make AE2's special crafting components. \\n \\n The easiest way to locate a meteorite is by crafting a &eMeteorite Compass&r by placing a compass inside of a Charger.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.processors": "Once you have obtained a full set of the required &eInscriber Presses&r, it's time to start making some &eProcessors&f. These are an important crafting ingredient used to make the large majority of ME-connected devices.",

The standard &eME Terminal&f simply lists everything in the network as one large grid to pull from and insert into, akin to a single inventory. \\n \\n The &eME Crafting Terminal&f is an extension of the ME Terminal which also provides a built-in crafting grid, allowing for convenient crafting using any item contained in the network and visible through the terminal screen.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.network": "The &bNetwork Tool&f is an important tool throughout AE2, which is used to display various details of a network on-screen such as overall power consumption and storage. \\n \\n As an added bonus, it also provides its own small inventory used to hold &eupgrade cards&f, which can be accessed when looking at any upgradeable device's screen for easy replacement. However, it cannot rotate blocks attached to the ME network like a regular wrench, only dismantle them when sneaking.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.fluix": "Arguably the most important resource you will need next is &eFluix&f, used throughout the vast majority of AE2 devices and serving as a base for crafting all of the cabling within an ME network. \\n \\n You'll typically want to mass produce these, and the way to do so is to make a &bFluix Crystal&f by throwing &eNether Quartz&f, &e&oCharged&r&e Certus quartz&r and &eRedstone&f together in a pool of water. This will give you a &eFluix Crystal&r which you can turn to dust in an Inscriber.",
	"atm9.quest.ae2.desc.cables": "To connect the vast majority of your ME network together, you will need some cable. &eME Glass Cable&f is the first and most basic kind of cable, and you'll be making this all throughout as the first step towards crafting the other kinds of cable. \\n \\n Both glass cables and their &ecovered&f counterpart can carry up to 8 channels along a single section of cabling. Unlike glass cables, covered cables can subsequently be crafted into &edense&f covered cables, capable of carrying up to 32 channels. However, most 'multipart' devices such as buses and terminals cannot be directly attached to dense cables, requiring normal-width cables to form a connection instead. \\n \\n All cables can also be crafted with dye to colour them.

This makes it ideal for processing ore blocks when enchanted with Fortune, for example. \\n Any added enchantments significantly increase the amount of energy used by the plane every time a block is broken. Enchanting the plane with &eEfficiency&f will decrease the overall energy use incurred by all other enchantments, while the &eUnbreaking&f enchantment gives the plane the chance to only use any energy sometimes, similarly to Unbreaking on regular tools.",

	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.end": "To get into Draconic Evolution you'll need Chaos Shards. Chaos Shards are in Chaos Islands guarded by Chaos Guardians in the End. Go to the End at an X/Z coordinate that is a multiple of 10k. 10k, 10k / 10k, 20k / 20k, 20k etc.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.prep": "Now before you get to the Chaos Island I recommend preparing, he may look like the Ender Dragon but this one is much more difficult. You'll want Draconic Weapons or Tools that do a lot of damage as those will make it easier. He will also do a crap-ton of damage good Armor like Unobtainium or Meka-Suit will be recommeneded. (Also effects of Regeneration, Absorption, and Resistance will help you survive}. Don't wprry you can always come back to fight another day if you aren't ready.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.destroy": "The first stage of the fight involves breaking the Crystals that hold the Chaos Guardians Shield. You can't hurt him until they are destroyed. Destroying these crystals is no easy task without a Draconic weapon. Chaos Guardian fire balls can weaken this shield allowing you to destroy it. (Yes, he will need too shoot at you/hitting the crystals). You'll notice particles being produced when it's vulnerable to damages and when hit will make a noise. The closer to destruction the deeper the noise and dimmer the Crystal will get. Once they are destroyed you can finally damage him!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.guardian": "Now the actual fight starts, he has two health bars both need to get taken to 0 to get the Chaos Shards. Don't get too close or he'll hit you with a barrage of Fireballs! {BTW in older versions the Chaos Guardian could even kill someone in Creative mode! Fortunately it can't anymore)",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.shard": "Once defeated he'll drop EXP, a Dragon Heart, and most importantly free the Chaos Shards. Look to where Lightning will strike then mine below it. There you will find the Chaos Shard. Mine it to be granted 5 Chaos Shards which can be crafted into smaller parts of it!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.module": "Modules are very important to our DE items. So important they don't work without them! Most Modules are made from a Module Core or a previous Module. Hold an item and press Shift and C to open the Module Menu. There you'll see some slots and buttons! The Slots are where Modules will actually go and the Grid is what determines how many Modules can go. When a Module says 1x1 it'll only take 1 Slot, while one that says 2z2 will take uo 4 slots. The lowest button on the right will show what Modules can be applied to the Item you are holding. The rest just change the look of GUI.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.BEnM": "Energy Modules are the most important Modules and are needed for using DE items. The amount in them determines how much OP an item can hold and take in, check out the Energy Infuser to learn more about charging. The later the Tier of Energy Module the more OP items can hold and use. This is important as when items are upgraded they use more OP per use.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WEnL": "Wireless Energy Links help to make it so Wireless Crystals can charge your items. The more modules, the more OP it can take it and at a better rate.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.QEnT": "The better the Energy Link or Tunnel obviously the more OP it can transfer, but also you might have noticed sonething missing with the Energy Link. It doesn't work between Dimensions! Thankfully the better ones can, just make sure the other side is chunkloaded.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.BSpM": "Speed Modules are fun, they work in just about everything and make them faster! Swords swing faster, Pickaxes mine faster, Axes chop faster, Bows shoot faster, and Chestplate makes you faster. The better the Speed Module the faster they go! (BTW good time to mention most stats stack up. 2 Basic Speed Modules increase Speed by 20%% then!)",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WPDaM": "These Modules are only for the DE Bows, unlike the previous ones. The Projectile Damage Module increases the damage of Arrows shot by the Bow. Some Modules happen to have negative effects with it, like these give a slight more Inaccuracy to Bows. All of these can stack!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WPVeM": "Velocity is the speed of an item at a certain direction. Since our Arrow aren't from Guardians of the Galaxy it basically just means the Speed of an Arrow. With each upgrade it takes less time from the Arrow to go from your Bow to your Target. Comes at a cost of a little inaccuracy.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.PICaM": "Thanks to Newton we know for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Basically when an Arrow hits a mob the force of the Mob applies to the Arrow which will slow it down. Unless you have this Module. It doesn't act as if every mob was paper, it acts as if every mob isn't in the way. Arrows won't slow down after Piercing a target.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WPPeM": "If you haven't played Minecraft since 1.13 this might confuse you, but you know Crossbows and Piercing. They have an enchantment which allows their Arrows to go through multiple targets and continuously dealing damage. This Module does exactly that!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WPAcM": "With something so primitive as a Bow you can't expect perfect Accuracy. Well you can if you use these Modules. The Arrow is much more likely to hit its target and not go off course.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.AFiM": "Most Bows are Semi-Automatic. You have to draw the string, release, and put another Arrow in the bow, and repeat. Instead skip all that let the Bow automatically fire everytime it's fully drawn. Just hold Right Click and watch it go!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WPGrCM": "What is up with Physics and De and betraying them? Gravity pulls the Arrow down over the time it's shot. Gravity Compensation makes us worry less about that.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.BAOEM": "Area of Effect is a phrase most Gamers would know. Basically it upgrades the working area of the Tool it's on. Pickaxes with 3x3 AOE will mine in a 3x3 area. Swords with 3x3 AOE will kill all mobs hit within that area. The better the upgrade the bigger the area. No, it's not stackable!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.ECoM": "Items gotten from the Tool this is on will go to your Ender Chest. The Minecraft one not modded one.",

	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WUnM": "Undying acts as the thing that makes it, the Recovery Totem! When your hearts are down to 0 instead of dying the Module will activate, giving you Absorption and Regeneration, saving your life. It has a Cooldown and needs to use OP to power up again. Try not to die during that time! Better upgrades means less cooldowns.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WSCaM": "Chestplates work similar to the Meka-Suit. Any damage that would be dealt to you is negated and instead taken off your Shield. Shield capacity is how much Shield you can hold, recharge rate is how fast it fills up, and OP will be used when recharging.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WLSCaM": "Same as the previous quest, just more, a lot more.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WSReM": "Want your Shield to come back and not just when you almost die? Then, you'll need Recovery Modules. The more Modules the faster it recovers.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.NVM": "Unless you're a little cheater who uses Night Vision Texture Packs, you might find the dark a little worry some. Thankfully Night Vision Module in a DE Chestplate helps get over the fear of not being able to see in the dark. Not the fear of what's in the dark though...",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WSCoM": "Shield Control changes the actual Shielf you have and when it regenerates.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.AAM": "Water is a little viscous, or atleast more dense than air. Because of that Mining Underwater is slower. You can use the Enchantment of Aqua Affinity, or use this Module. Your choice!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.WFlM": "With this on your Chestplate you can Glide! As if you were using an Elytra (But without cost of Armor). I don't like to call it flying, rather 'falling with style'.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.DFlM": "Okay now this ones give both Gliding and actual Flying, Creative Flight to be more exact.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.MSM": "When 'falling' your Mining is slowed down. That includes when creative flying or even bouncing in water. Thankfully you can use Air Affinty Enchantment to negate that! Not a vanilla Enchantment but still helpful! Oh wait I was supposed to talk about the Module... same thing!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.BJuM": "Legit just Jump Boost.",

	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.BAFeM": "Auto-Feed will automatically feed you any food in your Inventory when hungry. It has a max Food Point storage though, each full bar is 2 Food Points. So the Basic one can only hold 8 Steaks worth.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.binder": "Operational Potentional is the Energy source of Draconic Evolution. The main way (not the only way) of moving OP is with IO Relay Crystals. To actually get OP into items you'll need an Energy Transfer.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.IO": "The IO Crystals work as blocks that can connect to each other and move power from one another. To link them Shift Right Click with a Crystal Binder to set one and then right click whichever Crystal you want connected. When you look at the Crystal it will say either Input from block or Output to block. Input is the one you want to take OP from and Output to where you want it to go.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.transfuser": "Before you get here first you need an item that needs OP in it: Wyvern Bow, Chaotic Capacitor, Staff of Power whatever. Then you need an Energy Module in the item, that determines the OP storage in the item and that's what the item will use to power up. Once you have that, make and place the Energy Transfuser, get OP in it, then place your item into it! You'll know it's working when the OP in it lights up and moves.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.core": "The Energy Core is one, if not the, greatest Energy bank in all of Minecraft. And it all starts with the Core. This is the middle and heart of the Energy Core Multiblock (make sure it's a bit off the ground). When you place it down you can see it's GUI with the: Build Guide, Tier Down, Tier Up, and Assemble Core. The Tiers determine how big and powerful the Core is. The Build Guide shows you how to assemble this Tier of Core. If you have all the blocks necessary you can press Assemble Core and it will automatically make it!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.pylon": "Pylons are how you get OP in and out of the Energy Core. Place them atleast close to the Core, 2 of them 1 for input and 1 for output (you can use more). Then, place Glass over them and they will be assembled automatically targeting the closest Energy Core. Right Click the newly formed balls ontop of the Pylons to change whether they are Input or Output (you'll know from the arrows and design of them). Then, you can attach Crystals to them to move OP in and out!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.stabilizer": "Energy Core Stabilizers... stabilize? The Core. For the first 4 Tiers of Cores you need only 4 Stabilizers around it. You can access the GUi of the Core through the Stabilizers as well. If they are placed too close to the Core or in the wrong spots it will tell you it's incorrect.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.1": "Tier 1 only needs the Core and 4 Stabilizers to be made.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.2": "Tier 2 needs 6 Draconium Ingot Blocks, 1 on each side of the Core. Then, obviously the 4 Stabilizers to be made.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.3": "Tier 3 needs 26 Draconium Ingot Blocks around it, fully encasing the Core, to be made.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.4": "Tier 4 is different. First, it needs 26 Redstone Blocks encasing the Core. Then above the Redstone it needs 56 Draconium Ingot Blocks.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.more_stabilizers": "For Tier 5-8 you'll need Advanced Stabilizers. What's an Advanced Stabilizer? It's 9 Stabilizers all in a 3x1x3 Area. When made right it'll transform into a circle! Just do that same way you'd do 1 Stabilizer.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.more_pylons": "Technically this is optional but recommended! You can use more Pylons to take in and out more OP!",

	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.8": "Last and the best one Tier 8! You'll need 378 Awakened Draconium Blocks and 786 Draconium Ingot Blocks! Is it worth it?",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.RStabilizer": "Stabilizers are what form the Containment Field (Force Shield around the Reactor Core). Once Containment Shield is down to 0 while Reactor is turned on it will begin a Meltdown. All 4 Stabilizers need to be a few blocks away (5 or more) from the Core and need to be around same Axis as the Core to work. These are also where you will pipe out OP from the Reactor, just not too mcuh!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.injector": "The Injector needs to be on a different side of all the Stabilizers and has to share the same Axis as the Core. This is where OP will need to pumped in from! To activate and make OP the Energy Saturation needs to be raised up a bit. Energy Saturation is the stored Energy and soon to be made Energy.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.RCore": "The Reactor Core is the most important part of the Reactor, IE the Core! Place it 5 blocks or more from the Injector and Stabilizers, and you can right click it to see it's GUI here you'll find a few bars, a ball, buttons, and slots. The Bars go from left to right: Heat, Containment Field, Energy Saturation, and Fuel Conversion. You already learned about the Field and Energy and you will learn about the Fuel in a next quest. So the Heat is pretty important as when warming up it will raise to 2000C before being ready to activate. Make sure it doesn't get too high or else... meltdown! The Ball is the image of your Core, right now I have a bug where the Core doesn't have a texture so I can't explain much. The Buttons change the appearance of GUI, to activate or shutdown the Reactor, and charge it.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.fuel": "The Reactor takes Awakened Draconium as Fuel, don't worry its efficient! Fuel Conversion determines when the Awakened Draconium will change to Chaos. It can take only 8 BLocks at a time and can only be Fueled or Refueled when the Reactor is shut off. SAS mode helps to make that easier! Also Fuel goes into the bottom right Slots.",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.power": "The Reactor can only hold 1 Billion OP and while that may seem like a far number, it won't be for long. When Energy Saturation reaches 100%% it will increase Heat a ton which can lead to Meltdown. It will need 500,000,000 OP to activate and a Flux Gate will help limit how much OP comes in and out. (BTW 1 RF = 1 OP) They need Redstone to activate and can be used for both adding OP and taking out OP. You'll need Energy out to not Meltdown, try putting it in an Energy Core!",
	"atm9.quest.draconic.desc.on": "500 Million OP? Check. Fuel? Check. Heat at 2000 C? Check. Just click that activate button and pray it doesn't Meltdown!",

On death it'll drop its meat and shells. Its meat can be blessed in an Altar of Amethyst to be better.

It can chomp on you, smack you with its tentacles, or can hold you still and fire a Godzilla like beam at you. When brought below half health its beams become much more used and much more dangerous. It will fire beams all around it and will randomly fire them from its mouth at you. If you some how kill it you'll be granted a Tidal Claw, an Abyssal Egg, and could be a music disc: Endless Storm.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.remnant": "The &eAncient Remnant&r is master of his domain, sand. He has 4000 Hearts and multiple attacks like smacking you with his claws, slamming the ground, and making sandstorms which will lift you high in the air. It will also dash at you and swing its full body weight at you. Its attacks remain the same through the whole fight and careful of the &eKoboletons&r they got sticky hands. Once put back to the grave it will drop its Skull, Sandstorm in a bottle, and at a chance its music disc: Sands of Dominion.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.harbinger": "&4The Harbinger&r takes a lot of inspiration from what powers him, the Nether Star. He will fly around and shoot Wither Missiles at you which can give you wither effect. He also has lasers he can shoot you with, laser gatlings and a big mouth beam. He has 7800 Hearts and a big weakness, the EMPs. When powered with redstone they'll damage all the machines nearby. Once defeated he'll drop a block of Witherite and perhaps a music disc: Monster Fight.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.monstrosity": "The &cNetherite Monstrosity&r lives up to his name, he's a beast of Netherite and lava and has 15000 Hearts. It has very basic attacks, if you get close he'll ground slam you, if you're farther he'll shoot lava at you which creates lava source blocks. He only has 1 stage, kinda boring. When killed he'll drop the Infernal Forge, Monstrous Horn, and maybe a music disc: vs Titans.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.ignis": "Once you use the Burning Ashes on the Alter of Flame you'll get the &bIgnis&r. He has 6750 Hearts and has a massive sword and shield. The shield will block damage you give and the sword can be used to stab you. Once stabbed, you can't move you can only attack. He can also pounce on you and throw fireballs at you. Once you beat his health halfway he will start stage 2. At stage 2 he will change colors to a light blue and will get many more attacks with his sword and shield. Also throughout the fight all damage he gives to you, heals him. Once defeated he'll drop 1 Ignitium which you can use to craft your own versions of his weapons. He also might drop his music disc: God of Blaze.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.EGuardian": "The &dEnder Guardian&r is a hulking beast of endstone,purpur, and obsidian. It has 4995 Hearts and 2 stages. In first stage it will have very basic attacks of punching you, dashing, using shulker orbs, hitting you with Void Runes, and can stunlock you. Once you beat it down half way it's helmet will break exposing it's real head and starting the 2nd stage. To start he will break the floor of the arena exposing the floor below, then he will use the same moves while pulling you closer. (Also he is immune to arrows so I hope you have a good sword!). Once killed it will drop a Gauntlet of Guard and has a chance of dropping its music disc: Eternal.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.claws": "Tidal Claws are a confirmed drop from &5The Leviathan&r. It has two modes, attack and grapple. Attack is with left click, grapple is with right click. When you use its attack it will launch the claw and go through max of 5 mobs. Dealing damage and giving abyssal curse which will continue to damage them. The grapple does similar but will latch on to whatever is in range and pull you toward it. There's no durability so enjoy it forever!",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.egg": "The Abyssal Egg is also a drop from &5The Leviathan&r, because apparently you killed a pregnant one. Place down the Egg and wait awhile and you'll have your own baby Leviathan. Like its mother it'll attack other sea creatures. Unlike its mother it won't attack you first.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.skull": "Want another pet from Cataclysm? Then the Remnant Skull is what you need. It's a confirmed drop from the &eAncient Remnant&r and when used will spawn a Modern Revenant. This one is much smaller and nicer than the &eAncient&r one though. You can tame it by feeding it a Sniffer Egg then it will act like a dog. Attacking what attacks you or what you attack. It also has 3 modes: follow, wander, and stay. Follow it will... well follow you. Wander will have it walking around a certain area. And stay will have it lay down in one spot. Enjoy your new dino!",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.sandstorm": "Sandstorm in a bottle is an item you wear for a special effect. It goes in the Belt slot and when you press default X you will turn into a sandstorm. It is solely for movement, as you can fly for a little bit, it doesn't deal damage or reflect it, just movement. It doesn't negate fall damage though so careful when you get out of it.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.witherite": "Witherite is a drop from &4The Harbinger&r, it will always drop 1 block which can be made into 9 ingots. Witherite is used to craft 3 weapons and the Mechanical Fusion Anvil.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.IForge": "The Infernal Forge is a drop from the &cNetherite Monstrosity&r and is technically not a weapon, it's a pickaxe! It can be used to mine up to netherite tier, so it can mine Allthemodium ore. When right clicked it will attack in an AOE mode. Pounding the ground hitting everything close by. (Can be enchanted with sword and pickaxe enchantments)",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.helm": "By combining a Netherite Upgrade Template, a Netherite Helmet, and a Monstrous Horn to make the Monstrous Helm. It has better stats and when you're at half health it'll do knockback everything close to you and increase defense stats.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.igntium": "Ignitium is like Netherite but takes actual skill to get it. The &bIgnis&r will only drop 1 so get good use of it. You can use it to upgrade your netherite armor or use it to make 2 weapons.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.gauntlet": "The Gauntlet of Guard is more of a tool than a weapon, it brings in mobs closer when you hold right click with it. Then you can smack the enemies with it to do a bit of damage.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.gatling": "The Gatling Laser is a weapon you can make from Witherite. By using Redstone in your inventory you can shoot lasers which start fires and do damage. It shoots 50 lasers per 1 redstone which I think is a good deal.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.meat": "The Meat Shredder is a Melee weapon you can make from Witherite. It has two attacks, tapping left click and holding it. When you tap left click it'll use the Meat Shredder like an Axe, hitting them once from a decent range. When you hold it though it will repeatedly shred them with it's saw doing much quicker damage from closer.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.WASW": "The Wither Assault Shoulder Weapon (W.A.S.W.) is the last weapon you can make from Witherite. It has 2 different projectiles it can shoot: Wither Missiles and Wither Howitzers. The Wither Missiles shoot from just holding right click, and will damage whatever hit them with low cooldown. The Wither Howitzers are fired when you shift hold right click, they damage a bigger area and leave an area of wither effect that damages whatever walks in it. They have much longer cooldown though.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.bulwark": "You like the &bIgnis'&r shield? Well you can make 1 of your own with Ignitium. The Bulwark of the Flame can be used like a normal shield but also has a special effect. When holding right click and shift, letting go will let you charge at whatever is infront of you, like how goats do. Whatever gets hit will take damage and if pinched against a wall will also get stunned. Definitely nice to have around!",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.incinerator": "My personal favorite and one of the most powerful. The Incinerator can be used just like a normal sword and enchanted like one. But when holding right click it does something no normal sword does. When you hold and let go of right click for a few seconds, massive flames will strike out of the ground in the direction you are looking at then will explode.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.anvil": "The Mechanical Fusion Anvil will be needed to make the void and fused weapons. It places like a normal anvil but does not have durability.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.VASW": "The Void Assault Shoulder Weapon (V.A.S.W.) is just like the Wither version but better. Now it only shoots Void Howitzers which will do more damage and cause void runes to come out of the ground in the area the Howitzer hit. Just at the cost of the long cooldown, but we've got time to wait. It can crafted by combining the WASW and a Void Core in the Mechanical Infusion Anvil.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.VForge": "The Void Forge is not much different from the Infernal Forge. Same attack damage and speed, same pickaxe tier, just summons Void Runes when attacking. Can be crafted by combining an Infernal Forge and a Void Core in a Mechanical Fusion Anvil.",
	"atm9.quest.cataclysm.desc.GoB": "The Gauntlet of Bulwark acts not as you'd assume. Instead of bringing mobs closer it pushes them away, when holding right click, and gives them Blazing Brand. Then when you release right click you'll do the normal charge. It's made by fusing the Gauntlet of Guard with a Bulwark of Flame in the Mechanical Fusion Anvil.",
